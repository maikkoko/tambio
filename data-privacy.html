        If you are visiting the Services from outside the Philippines, please be aware that you are sending information (including
        Personal Data) to the Philippines where we are located. That information may then be transferred within the Philippines
        or back out of the Philippines to other countries outside of your country of residence, depending on the type of information
        and how it is stored by us. These countries (including the United States) may not necessarily have data protection
        laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of residence; however, our collection, storage and use
        of your Personal Data will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy.

      <p>The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make
        changes to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update or modify this Privacy Policy
        at any time (collectively, "Modifications"). Modifications to this Privacy Policy will be posted to the Site with a

        will be effective thirty (30) days following the "Updated" date or such other date as communicated in any other notice
        to you.</p>

      <h2>16. Data Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>Data Privacy Policy requires Tambio and Organizers using the Service to provide Users with more information about the
        processing of their Personal Data.</p>

      <p>Here is what you need to know:</p>

      <p class="subheader">Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data</p>

      <p>The Data Privacy requires us to tell you about the legal ground we're relying on to process any Personal Data about you.
        The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Section 4 above will typically be
        because:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>you provided your consent;</li>
        <li>it is necessary for our contractual relationship;</li>
        <li>the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; and/or</li>
        <li>
          processing is in our legitimate interest as an event organising and raffle promo platform (for example, to protect
          the security and integrity of our systems and to provide you with customer service, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="subheader">Your rights.</p>

      <p>Data Privacy law provides you with rights in respect of Personal Data that we hold about you, including the right to
        request a copy of the Personal Data, request that we rectify, restrict or delete your Personal Data, object to profiling
        and unsubscribe from marketing communications.</p>

      <p>If you have a complaint about how we handle your Personal Data, please get in touch with us as set forth in Section 15
        to explain.</p>

      <p class="subheader">Tambio as a data controller and a data processor</p>

      <p>There is a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as "data controllers")
        and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "data processors"). If you
        have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these should always be directed to the relevant
        data controller since they are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.</p>

      <p>Tambio may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances.</p>

      <p>For example, if you enter into a contract with us to organize your events or raffle promo, Tambio will be a data controller
        in respect of the Personal Data that you provide as part of your communications with us. We will also be a data controller
        of the Personal Data that we have obtained about the use of the Applications or Tambio Properties, which could relate
        to Organizers or Consumers. We use this to conduct research and analysis to help better understand and serve Users
        of the Services as well as to improve our platform and provide you with more targeted recommendations about events
        or raffle promo we think may be of interest to you.</p>

      <p>However, if you register for an event or raffle promo as a Consumer, we will process your Personal Data to help administer
        that event or raffle promo on behalf of the Organizer (for example, sending event or raffle information, raffle tickets,
        confirmation email or Facebook messages etc.) and to help the Organizer target, and understand the success of, their
        event or raffle promo and event or raffle promo planning (for example, providing reports, using analytics to gain insights
        into the effectiveness of various channels, etc.). In these circumstances, Tambio merely provides the "tools" for Organizers;
        Tambio does not decide what Personal Data to request on registration forms, nor is it responsible for the continued
        accuracy any Personal Data provided. Any questions that you may have relating to your Personal Data and your rights
        under data protection law should therefore be directed to the Organizer as the data controller, not to Tambio.
